# Control CPU loading to 1~2%

This project simulates controlled CPU usage for testing and benchmarking purposes, allowing fine-tuning of resource consumption.

## Get Started

```shell
sudo apt install make g++
make
./main
```

## Adjusting CPU Usage

To fine-tune the CPU usage, modify the `BUSY_TIME` and `IDLE_TIME` variables in the source code to adjust the balance between active and idle periods.
